BFS and DFS Python Implementation

"I’ve been working with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms, which are key for exploring graph structures. BFS is really effective for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs since it explores all the neighboring nodes at one level before moving to the next. On the other hand, DFS dives deep into a path, exploring it as far as possible before backtracking, which makes it perfect for tasks like maze generation or checking graph connectivity.

So far, I’ve created five Python codes that showcase a wide range of visualizations, highlighting how BFS and DFS work across different types of graphs and mazes. The visualizations are great because they allow you to see the traversal process in real-time—nodes are highlighted as the algorithms visit them. Alongside the visualizations, I’ve also implemented a simple array output that lists the nodes in the order they were visited during the BFS or DFS traversal. Together, these features make it much easier to understand the differences between the two algorithms and how they navigate through graphs."
